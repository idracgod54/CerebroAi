# üß† CerebroAI

> *"Most AI responds. This one reflects."*

Cerebro is an AI agent that doesn‚Äôt just chat ‚Äî it **remembers**, **reflects**, and **grows** with you over time.

It‚Äôs built on a new philosophy:  
AI should be less like a tool, and more like an **extension of your mind**.  
It should hold on to what matters. It should adapt. And most of all ‚Äî **it should be yours**.

---

## üöÄ What Makes It Different?

- **üß† Human-level memory & reflection**  
  Not just short-term context. Cerebro reflects in the background, connects conversations, and forms persistent memories ‚Äî like a thinking agent, not a chatbot.

- **üîì Yours, not theirs**  
  Whether it‚Äôs running on your laptop or someday hosted in the cloud, each instance is uniquely tuned to you. Your data, your memories, your outcomes ‚Äî never generic, never shared.

---

> This is what AI should‚Äôve always been:  
> **Private. Persistent. Personal.**
> 
Cerebro isn‚Äôt just another AI assistant.  
It‚Äôs the start of a new relationship between humans and machines ‚Äî one where memory, reflection, and ownership are built in from the beginning.

Most AI tools forget you the second a conversation ends.  
Cerebro doesn‚Äôt.  
It reflects on what you say, draws insight from what matters, and learns alongside you ‚Äî not from some distant server, but *right here*, on your own machine.

It‚Äôs not built to mimic intelligence.  
It‚Äôs built to **grow it** ‚Äî with you.

## üîß How It Works

Cerebro combines multiple technologies into a unified, extensible system:

- **Local LLM Orchestration** via Ollama ‚Äî runs open-source models on your machine
- **Reflection Engine** ‚Äî a separate background reasoning model trained to extract insights, values, and memories from your conversations
- **Vector Memory** using ChromaDB ‚Äî stores context, memories, and long-term semantic associations
- **Custom Tooling** ‚Äî tools like weather, search, or file access are invoked natively through Python and streamed to the LLM
- **Optional Speech Interface** ‚Äî TTS (ElevenLabs) and Whisper for full voice control
- **Modular Architecture** ‚Äî easy to expand tools, memory types, or front-ends (Eel, PySide, Electron-style HTML, etc.)

Everything runs **offline, locally**, by default ‚Äî no cloud API calls unless explicitly configured.

## üéØ Use Cases

- **Second-brain productivity agent** ‚Äî Remembers projects, tasks, tools, and notes
- **Personal growth coach** ‚Äî Reflects on your decisions, habits, and thoughts over time
- **Developer companion** ‚Äî Debugs code, remembers your stack, adapts to your habits
- **Therapeutic journaling tool** ‚Äî Helps identify patterns, triggers, and growth moments
- **Custom AI appliance** ‚Äî For power users who want full control over their models, memory, and reflection logic

## üî≠ Vision & Roadmap

We're building the foundation of long-term, memory-driven AI ‚Äî a system that can:
- Learn from experience without needing to be retrained
- Reflect and revise its behavior using a secondary internal model
- Run across devices ‚Äî from laptops to edge hardware to cloud VMs
- Offer **true AI ownership** to individuals and organizations alike

The long-term goal is a plug-and-play cognitive platform:
> **Local-first. Reflection-native. Tuned to the person, not the platform.**

Planned future milestones:
- ‚òëÔ∏è MVP (local memory, RAG, tool calling)
- ‚è≥ Remote hosting with encrypted personal contexts
- ‚è≥ Multi-agent shared memory & reflection spaces
- ‚è≥ Mobile & voice-first interfaces
- ‚è≥ App SDK for 3rd-party memory-powered AI agents

## üß© Status
Cerebro is in active development.  
We‚Äôre currently building the MVP and validating its core architecture for both single-user and multi-user scenarios.
